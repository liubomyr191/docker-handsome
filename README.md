# Handsome Dashboard Framework

## What is Handsome?

Handsome is a dashboard framework written in ruby and [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/).

It is currently a work-in-progress.

Handsome is a cousin to [Dashing](http://dashing.io), which is also a ruby-based dashboard framework.

## How does Handsome differ from Dashing?

Handsome's front-end is powered by [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), while Dashing's is powered by [Batman.js](http://batmanjs.org/)

Handsome uses a polling model to update dashboards, while Dashing streams data using [Server Sent Events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events).
